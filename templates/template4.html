    <h1> 52-hertz whale</h1>
<p> If you have ever listened to the sound of a whale (which you can do online), you will know what it sounds like. These whales call at a frequency of 15 and 25 Hertz. However, the 52-Hertz whale, which is an individual whale, calls at a frequency of 52 Hertz., which is simply off the charts. The calling of this whale is so unique that experts believe that other whales are not able to hear him. People are fascinated by the 52-Hertz, its world is still quite unknown to humans, but for many, its story is quite relatable.</p>
